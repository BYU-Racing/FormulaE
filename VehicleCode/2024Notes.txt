Really just to keep my head from spinning to much as I develop out these beginning ideas of the code

NEW FORMAT FOR CAN MESSAGES

ID RANGE 1-50
    NORMAL RUNNING OF SENSORS

ID RANGE OF 51-100 -> Calculated VIA SensorID + 50
    SENSOR ERROR

ID RANGE OF 101-104 
    DIAGNOSTIC STARTS



WHAT DOES HEALTH MEAN??

    HEALTH 0 = UNKNOWN

    HEALTH 1 = CRITICAL FUNCTIONS FAILED

    HEALTH 2 = CRITICAL FUNCTIONS WORKING - OTHER FAILED

    HEALTH 3 = ALL FUNCTIONS WORKING



ECU & DATA COLLECTOR HEALTH COMS
    On start ECU calls for the health of the Car
        CAN message sent out that triggers the DCs to run a self health check report

    Responds with the above health (Sensors might need to have an extra attribute that tells the DC how critical they are)
